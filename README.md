## Deep Learning Holiday Image Manipulation
Created by Noah Walsh, Ben Valois, Rick Djeuhon, Derek Windahl "VerseForty", and Jake Hamilton

Our project manipulates a non-holiday image to appear more like a holiday with the deep convolutional neural network Inception v3, that we trained with a custom holiday classification image dataset.

## Environment
- python3
- keras
- tensorflow
- pillow


## How to use it
Run the TrainHolidayV3.ipynb notebook, making sure the paths to the training data folder Holiday_images is correct, which can be downloaded from the Google Drive Folder, Data for Deep Learning Holiday Image Manipulation Project. Then run the HolidayImageManipulator.ipynb notebook, making sure that the paths to the input image you want to manipulate and the resulting output image are correct.
