## Deep Learning Holiday Image Manipulation
Created by Noah Walsh, Ben Valois, Rick Djeuhon, Derek Windahl, and Jake Hamilton

Our project manipulates a non-holiday image to appear more like a holiday with the deep convolutional neural network Inception v3, that we trained with a custom holiday classification image dataset.

## Environment
- python3
- keras
- tensorflow
- pillow


## How to use it
Run the train.py file, making sure the paths to the training data is correct. Then run the HolidayImageManipulation.py file, making sure that the paths to the output image you want to manipulate and the resulting output image are correct.
